"""HTTP server classes.

Note: BaseHTTPRequestHandler doesn't implement any HTTP request; see
SimpleHTTPRequestHandler for simple implementations of GET, HEAD and POST.

It does, however, optionally implement HTTP/1.1 persistent connections.

XXX To do:

- log requests even later (to capture byte count)
- log user-agent header and other interesting goodies
- send error log to separate file

# Log files
# ---------
#
# Here's a quote from the NCSA httpd docs about log file format.
#
# | The logfile format is as follows. Each line consists of:
# |
# | host rfc931 authuser [DD/Mon/YYYY:hh:mm:ss] "request" ddd bbbb
# |
# |        host: Either the DNS name or the IP number of the remote client
# |        rfc931: Any information returned by identd for this person,
# |                - otherwise.
# |        authuser: If user sent a userid for authentication, the user name,
# |                  - otherwise.
# |        DD: Day
# |        Mon: Month (calendar name)
# |        YYYY: Year
# |        hh: hour (24-hour format, the machine's timezone)
# |        mm: minutes
